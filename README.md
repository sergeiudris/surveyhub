# surveyhub

- github but for surveys
- users can
  - create user.survey
    - text answers (can be +1 like post answers)
    - vote (can be commented and comments can be +1 so you get both vote distribution and most popular comment for an option)
  - set access
    - for anyone on the internet (no registration)
    - for surveyhub users
    - for specific users
    - for anyone with the link
  - browse top/recent etc. surveys
  - set continueous surveys (periodic snapshots)
  
## rationale

- github -> repos
- stackoverflow/reddit -> posts
- twitter -> tweets
- twitch  -> streams
- surveyhub -> surveys
